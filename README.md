 where users can set a budget, view available items within that budget,
 and make purchases accordingly. It utilizes the `pyttsx3` library for
 text-to-speech conversion, enhancing accessibility. The script includes
 predefined grocery items and their prices, guides users through the
 purchase process, and provides feedback on their selections. Overall,

 integration.
